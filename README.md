# Hive-Maps
iOS application targeting iOS 7+ provides tool for bee keeper to monitor bee hive health and productivity. 

In 2015, I met up with a local bee keeper in San Diego County. He worked with local home owners to humanely trap and re-queen agressive
bee hives on their properties. If interested, he would introduce home owners to bee keeping, highlighting the important role bees have
in local ecosystems. 
  
Over time, he realized he had no way of tracking the perfomance of the many bee hives he was keeping and noted a large number of bee hive
failures. We partenerd up to develop a mobile app solution to his problem. The long-term goal was to provide a tool for bee keepers to 
monitor thier own beehives, while building a database of bee population dynamics from citizen scientist. 

This project is functional for a single bee keeper, however, implimentation of a backend for crowd-sourcing the bee population data 
(and properly anonymization of the data) is still pending. 

The project utalizes several Cocoa Pods: AFNetworking and CorePlot, which have been updated to run in XCode 9. Included in the project file
are some screen shots of the application.
